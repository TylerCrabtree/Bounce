This project is for the game “Breakout.” The base code was given by Scott Wallace, the rest was implemented by myself (Tyler Crabtree). The controls mechanics are:

“A” to move the paddle left, and spin the ball left.
“S” to spin the ball down.
“D” to move the paddle right and spin the ball right.
“W” to spin the ball down.

Cheat codes are listed below:
“1” to jump to level 1 (from level 2 or 3).
“2” to jump to level 2.
“3” to jump to level 3.
“4” to jump to the ending screen.

The game begins with an example screen of how the game will be played, bricks cannot be destroyed in this splash screen, my name is listed in the top left corner along with game counters. After pressing space, the game will begin in the first stage. The goal of this stage is to bounce the ball off the paddle to hit all of the bricks towards the top. The bricks should disappear after one hit from the ball. If the ball touches the bottom, the lives counter will decrement and the ball will bounce off the screen if the player has any remaining lives. 

Upon destroying all the bricks on level 1, the level 1 counter should increment and level 2 should immediately begin. Level 2 adds a dragon enemy who will reduce lives or result in a game over upon a collision with the paddle.

Once all the bricks are destroyed on level 2, the level 2 counter should increment and level 3 should immediately begin. Level 3 adds another dragon enemy with a different directional path who will reduce lives or result in a game over upon a collision with the paddle. Level 3 also adds a heart power-up. After the bricks are destroy on this level, a winning screen should pop up. The game will repeat from here.
